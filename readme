Readme file for final project - Drug Dataset by Odelia Ahdout
Sentiment analysis of drug reviews assembled in a dataset from UCI

Research question.
Predicting the assessment of the drug based on the text review on a binary scale (negative/positive)
Caveat 1: target variable (rating) is on a scale from 1 to 10, and is skewed towards positive values (ratings of 9-10 make up of around 40% of all values).
Therefore, the binary scale (1-6 for negative, 7-10 for positive), might have to be further refined, in order to allow a better balancing of the data.
Caveat 2: relatedly, positive comments also tend to recieve more 'useful comment' votes, therefore cleaning less useful comments might further imbalance the data.

Methodology.
Supervised learning, possibly augmented with unsupervised models 
Features may contain, besides the review itself, other infos: the identity of the drug (i.e. its name, 'drugName'), the type of condition it targets (e.g. acne, depression, 'condition'),
and possibly other features concerning the review itself (e.g. its length, 'length').

Models/packages to be used.
- Classic n-grams, NLTK
- Word2Vec (SKlearn)
- SpaCy

Tentative plan.
[V] 2.3 Data cleaning, pre-modeling prep 
    3.3 Modeling:   [v]B.O.W model on review text {RanFor}; 
                    [v]TF-IDF {RanFor}; 
                    [v]tag+POS-filter {RanFor} >> ended up with same list!;
                    [not working] Bayes model
                    [not working] linear regression on non-text variables to determine their independent predictive force. 
    4.3 Modeling: [v]attempting fixing issues with NB and LIN REG
                   -> Classification instead of reg for non-review variables {RF, KNN}
    7.3 Modeling:  -> SpaCy for NP/VP phrases; recommend best drugs for a certain condition.  
    8.3 Notebook prep, visualization 
    9.3 presentation
