Sentiment analysis of drug reviews assembled in a dataset from UCI

Research question.
Predicting the assessment of the drug based on the text review on a ternery scale (negative/neutral/positive)
Caveat 1: target variable (rating) is on a scale from 1 to 10, and is skewed towards positive values (ratings of 9-10 make up of around 40% of all values).
Therefore, the binary scale (1-4 for negative, 5-6 neutrel, 7-10 for positive).
Caveat 2: relatedly, positive comments also tend to recieve more 'useful comment' votes, therefore cleaning less useful comments might further imbalance the data.

Data.
Features contain, besides the review itself, other infos: the identity of the drug (i.e. its name, 'drugName'), the type of condition it targets (e.g. acne, depression, 'condition'),
and possibly other features concerning the review itself (e.g. its length, 'length').

Methodology.
distilbert-base-uncased, for less computational demans
